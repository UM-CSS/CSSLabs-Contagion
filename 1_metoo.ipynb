    "- This lab uses data collected from Twitter. Before the lab, we already collected the data and did a lot to clean it up. In the lab, will focus on using the data to understand social contagion.\n",
    "- We will look at the spread of the hashtag #metoo on Twitter. [The Me Too Campaign began in 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/us/me-too-movement-tarana-burke.html). The hashtag became extremely popular on Twitter starting in October, 2017. It was tweeted more than 7 million times in the first 4 months after that.\n",
    "- Me Too is a social movement that calls attention to sexual assault and harassment. We will not be looking at the text of any of the tweets in this lab. For our purposes here, we just want to look at how being exposed to other people talking about #metoo on Twitter influences someone to also talk about #metoo on Twitter.\n",
